# wm4-homebrew

# What is this?
This is a compilation of our Homebrew Catalog for easy use with 5e.tools. 5e.tools provides an easier way to search through the mountain that is our homebrew content. 

This includes items, spells, perks, talents, gifts, curses, conditions, and *every* else that it can.

# How to Add!
## Step 1: Navigate to the Hombew Manager
On the home page of 5e.tools, click Utitlities > Homebrew Manager

## Step 2: Loading from URL
Click Load from URL, and enter the following link: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChumzyTS/wm4-homebrew/refs/heads/main/wm4-homebrew.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChumzyTS/wm4-homebrew/refs/heads/main/wm4-homebrew.json), then click OK! If everything worked, it should appear in the list as "Westmarch UTD"

And thats it! If you want to verify you can go to items, click filter and you should see "Westmarch UTD" under Homebrew.
