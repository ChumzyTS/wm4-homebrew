# What is this?
This is a compilation of our Homebrew Catalog for easy use with 5e.tools. 5e.tools provides an easier way to search through the mountain that is our homebrew content. 

This includes items, spells, perks, talents, gifts, curses, conditions, and *every* else that it can.

# How to Add/Update!
## Step 1: Navigate to the Hombew Manager
On the home page of 5e.tools, click Utitlities > Homebrew Manager

## Step 2: Loading from URL
Click Load from URL, and enter the following link: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChumzyTS/wm4-homebrew/refs/heads/main/wm4-homebrew.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChumzyTS/wm4-homebrew/refs/heads/main/wm4-homebrew.json), then click OK! If everything worked, it should appear in the list as "Westmarch UTD"

And thats it! If you want to verify you can go to items, click filter and you should see "Westmarch UTD" under Homebrew.

# Other Notes
## Found something missing/wrong?
The 5e.tools homebrew is only updated on semi-regular basis once rewards are given out and added to the [homebrew catalog](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tiToA5RnKt2pGXsPIT8XXOBbRKFVEKu-2gs7H3psY6I/edit?tab=t.0). This means there is sadly *A DELAY* in when things are added. 

If you've had something for over a week and it has yet to be added, check to see if it is in the [homebrew catalog](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tiToA5RnKt2pGXsPIT8XXOBbRKFVEKu-2gs7H3psY6I/edit?tab=t.0). If is not there, message the GM who gave you the reward and tell them to add it! If it **is on the homebrew catalog** then feel free to dm me (@selkiegem) or @me in #wm-discussion and I'll try to add it.

## Want to notified of updates?
Turn notifications on for this thread. I should only be sending new messages when things are updated!

That is all :3
