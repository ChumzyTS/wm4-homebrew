Any creature that decodes a ritual can use the octavo thereafter to summon the yugoloth named by the ritual. This requires 1 hour, rare incense and alchemical powders worth 5,000 gp, and the blood sacrifice of a creature of at least Medium size. When the ritual is completed, the yugoloth appears from the Lower Planes and the summoner must make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check contested by the yugoloth\u2019s Intelligence check.

If the summoner wins or ties the check, the yugoloth cannot attack or cast spells on the summoner (though any other creatures in the area are fair game) and is bound to obey the summoner for 24 hours. However, the yugoloth always bends and misinterprets the summoner\u2019s commands if it can, and the DM might call for Charisma checks to threaten, coax, or trick the yugoloth into doing exactly what the summoner wants. After 24 hours, the yugoloth vanishes back to Gehenna.",

This greatly annoys the affected yugoloths, which constantly scheme for revenge. If a summoned yugoloth can get its hands on the octavo, it can tear the book in half as an action, destroying it and summoning all the yugoloths whose names are written in the book. Those fiends appear at the start of the yugoloth\u2019s next turn, work together to kill the summoner and its allies, then go on a rampage of murder and destruction before returning to Gehenna 24 hours later.",
