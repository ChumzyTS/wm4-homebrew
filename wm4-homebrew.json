				"GMs can give out Formulas, details regarding the creation of items, as session rewards. A Formula can be used to create an item. Formulas are single use, and must detail the time it takes to create an item--generally, a long rest or a bastion turn.",
				"A Formula can have specific tool proficiency prerequisites in order to craft an item detailed within it, such as a {@item Smith's Tools|XPHB} proficiency to craft a metal item, or {@item Alchemist's Supplies|XPHB} or {@item Herbalism Kit|XPHB} proficiency to craft a potion. Additionally, they can require special ingredients or a gold cost that must be gathered before the detailed item can be made.",
				"A Formula can detail instructions for one item, a list of items, or a category of items. If a Formula details instructions for multiple items, the character who has the Formula must choose one item from the list or category to create. Different items in the same formula can have different costs, ingredients, time to craft, and tool prerequisites. "
