**Mystery Potion (Common)**
*Potion, Common, Consumable*

*Typically made as a byproduct by alchemists, this potion is fully unpredictable. Swirling this liquid causes its color to change rapidly between a variety of vibrant colors. Its smell is purely alchemical, providing no insight as to what could be inside.*

When you drink this potion, roll on the table below, gaining the effects of drinking or applying the rolled potion.

A creature can spend 1 hour studying the potion to attempt to identify and stabilize its effects. After the hour is done, the creature must make a DC 10 Intelligence (Alchemist's Supplies) check. On a pass, roll on the table transforming the Mystery Potion into the rolled potion.

**Heart of Gears**  
*Wondrous Item, Legacy (Requires Attunement by a Construct)*

*This large metal amalgamation of electrum gears empowers any construct it is installed into. The nature of the gears causes constructs to take on a more mechanical nature, allowing greater consistency in all that they do.*

When attuned to, the Heart of Gears is installed into the creature, disappearing and becoming one with it. When unattuned, the Heart of Gears reappears next to the creature.

Your movement speed is increased by 10 feet. You have Advantage on saving throws against the Prone condition.

**Engrained Talent (Level 5).** The Heart of Gears holds mechanical knowledge on tools. When you finish a Short or Long Rest, choose a tool that you aren't Proficient with. You gain proficiency with that tool until the end of your next Short or Long Rest. This feature starts unlocked.

**Clockwork Consistency (Level 7).** The Heart of Gears gains the ability to give consistency to attacks you make. It has 4 charges and regains 1d4 charges daily at dawn. When you make an attack roll, you can expend a charge to forgo rolling the d20 to get a 10 on the die. 

**Mechanical Nature (Level 9).** The Heart of Gears learns to adapt to absorb attacks made against you. Any Critical Hit against you becomes a normal hit.

**All-Around Programming (Level 11).** The Heart of Gears gains the ability to provide consistency in all that you do. You can use Clockwork Consistency on any D20 Test you make, not just attack rolls.

**Proper Oiling (Level 15).** The Heart of Gears improves, having 6 charges instead of 4, regaining 1d4+2 charges daily at dawn.

**Fine Tuned Machinery (Level 17).** The Heart of Gears improves allowing consistency all of the time. It has 8 charges instead of 6, and regains all charges daily at dawn. When you roll Initiative while the heart has no charges remaining, it regains 1d4+1 charges.

**Clockwork Mastery (Level 20).** The Heart of Gears learns when it is needed. When you make a D20 test, you can use a reaction to expend a charge to replace the number you roll with a 10.

**Legacy Rituals.** Three rituals are needed to unlock the abilities of the Heart of Gears.

* **Advanced Parts:** You must defeat a Construct of CR 6 or higher, and spend an hour to incorporate its components into the heart. This unlocks the Level 7-9 features.
